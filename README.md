## Preface

I desperately tried to make this book “work for everyone”, but that’s incredibly difficult.

So, to make the best out of this book:

- You should already know some HTML, CSS and JS: this is not a web development beginner guide.
- You should already know the basics of Typescript: I don’t expect you to be a Typescript champion, however, surface-level understanding will prepare you for all the Typescript in the book.

I wrote this book specifically for Mid, Senior and Senior+ engineers, and the book contains chapters of varying technical difficulty. However, I’ve done my best to explain these clearly and visually to satisfy different skill levels.

## Chapter 1: Build your first Astro Application

- Build a personal website with Astro.
- Set up a local development environment for Astro.

- Theming Astro sites via CSS variables.
- Leveraging markdown pages for ease.
- Deployment of a static Astro application.

## Chapter 2: Astro Components In-depth

- What zero Javascript means in practical terms.
- Why we should consider ditching the Javascript runtime overhead.
- Truly understand what an Astro component is.
- Understand the behaviour of Astro component markup, styles and scripts.

## Conclusion

Firstly, I strongly recommend visiting the official Astro [documentation](https://astro.build/). It’s a great resource that’ll benefit you long-term as you develop Astro applications.

Secondly, ponder the features that make Astro stand out:

- **Leverage Component Islands**: A new web architecture for building faster websites.
- **Zero JS, by default**: Keep applications fast with no JS runtime overhead.
- **Edge-ready**: Deploy anywhere, even global edge runtimes like Deno or Cloudflare.
- **Incredibly customizable**: Use Tailwind, MDX, and 100+ other [integrations](https://astro.build/integrations/).
- **Bring your own framework**: Supports React, Preact, Vue, Svelte, Solid, Lit and more.
